        The annual community cleanup event is scheduled for next Saturday. Volunteers will gather at the central park at 9:00 AM, where supplies and instructions will be distributed. This initiative aims to promote environmental awareness and foster a sense of collective responsibility.

        Following the cleanup, a local food truck rally will be hosted near the community center with free food vouchers for all registered participants. Music and family-friendly games will also be available throughout the day. We encourage all residents to participate and support a cleaner, greener neighborhood.

        In addition, the town hall will be holding a public forum on upcoming infrastructure projects. Residents are encouraged to voice their opinions and offer feedback to shape the future of our growing community.
